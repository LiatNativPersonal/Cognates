<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>ETS Corpus of Non-Native Written English, Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) 
  Catalog Number LDC2014T06 and ISBN 1-58563-675-4, was developed by <a href="https://www.ets.org/">Educational 
  Testing Service</a> and is comprised of 12,100 English essays written by speakers 
  of 11 non-English native languages as part of an international test of academic 
  English proficiency, <a href="http://www.ets.org/toefl/ibt/about">TOEFL</a> 
  (Test of English as a Foreign Language). The test includes reading, writing, 
  listening, and speaking sections and is delivered by computer in a secure test 
  center. This release contains 1,100 essays for each of the 11 native languages 
  sampled from eight topics with information about the score level (low/medium/high) 
  for each essay.</p>
<p>The corpus was developed with the specific task of native language identification 
  in mind, but is likely to support tasks and studies in the educational domain, 
  including grammatical error detection and correction and automatic essay scoring, 
  in addition to a broad range of research studies in the fields of natural language 
  processing and corpus linguistics. For the task of native language identification, 
  the following division is recommended: 82% as training data, 9% as development 
  data and 9% as test data, split according to the file IDs accompanying the data 
  set. </p>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>The data is sampled from essays written in 2006 and 2007 by test takers whose 
  native languages were Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, 
  Korean, Spanish, Telugu, and Turkish. The essays are presented in both original 
  raw and tokenized forms and presented in UTF-8 formatted text files. Also included 
  are the prompts (topics) for the essays and metadata about the test takers' 
  proficiency level. </p>
